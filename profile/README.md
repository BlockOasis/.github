# BlockOasis: A Smart Water Management Using IoT and Blockchain with Cartesi for African Nations

## Introduction
Smart water management leverages technology and data to enhance the efficacy of water distribution, usage, and treatment. In many African nations, accessing clean water remains a daunting task. We aim to address this by integrating IoT devices and Blockchain technology.

## Problems
A significant number of African cities are nearing 'Day Zero' - the day when they run out of water. This arises from:
- Water Scarcity
- Inefficient water management
- Lack of clean water access
- Limited data accuracy
- Scarce infrastructure
- Social and political challenges

Furthermore, industries contribute to water mismanagement through over-extraction, pollution, and privatization.

## Solution
Blockchain combined with IoT can be game-changing:

- **Real-time monitoring:** Ensure real-time data collection.
- **Smart contracts:** Automate compliance and ensure water usage is within stipulated limits.
- **Water trading:** Allow for buying and selling of water rights.
- **Supply chain traceability:** Track water from source to consumer, ensuring purity.

## Target Users
Our system targets:
- Water companies/Municipalities
- Industrial users
- Government agencies
- Consumers
- Environmental organizations
- Researchers
- Insurance companies
- Investors

The potential market is significant, with nearly 300 million Africans lacking clean water access and the African IoT market forecasted to touch $5.5 billion by 2025.

Our application will generate provable notifications on water usage, enabling on-chain logic like penalizing overuse. This data management is performed using Cartesi Rollup DApp and IoT aggregator stakeholder nodes, ensuring transparent, secure, and efficient water management.

**Stakeholder Nodes:** These nodes can be maintained by entities or individuals interested in smart water management. They can either act as IoT aggregators or Validators.

**Cartesi Rollups DApp:** This decentralized application validates claims and generates provable notifications on water usage.

**Protocol Overview:** IoT devices send data to the IoT aggregator node. This data is processed, stored, and then used to generate relevant notifications and metrics. Any discrepancies detected by validator nodes can be disputed, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of data and actions.

Join us in making water management transparent, efficient, and accessible to all African nations.
